# This file inside pipresents/pp_io_config will be used by Pi Presents if keys.cfg has not been found in a profile.
# A keys.cfg can be placed in a profile in its /pp_io_config directory. The profile will be searched first then here.

#   This fallback file in /pipresents/pp_io_config defines keys used:
#   -   Out of the box by mediashow, liveshow and menu.
#   -   In the manual's examples, in templates, and in the github examples

#  keys for hyperlinkshow and radiobuttonshow are not bound here as they will be different for each profile.
#  Examples are to be found in keys.cfg in the profile for the examples of these shows.

# This file  might be overwritten by updates
# If you edit it make a copy and place in the profile that is to use it.

# There is no checking of the content of this file by Pi Presents, try any changes by
#  running from a terminal window so that any exceptions are reported.

# This file binds keyboard keys to the symbolic names of the input events. Input events are of two types

#  - Show/track control - The input event affects shows/tracks. The Controls Field of shows and tracks bind symbolic names
#  - for input events to commands e.g. play-my5 play track5
#  - Direct  - the input event affects Pi Presents, for example by exiting it.


# All I/O SECTIONS
# ================
#    direction - in,out,none  if none then the section is ignored. out is currentyl not used in keys.cfg


# INPUT SECTIONS
# ===============
# direction = in
# mode - specific-character, any-character, specific-line, any-line
# name  - the symbolic name of the event which is generated if the input matches the match
# match - the condition for matching 

# for mode = specific character
# match may be:
# . a printable (non-special) character
# . a special key which is a name enclosed in <> e.g. <Return>

#    Theses terms are defined in
#    effbot.org/tkinterbook/tkinter-events-and-bindings.htm  in the <Return>, a, and <Shift-Up> sections.

# In additon to the specific-character input sections if bind-printing = yes in the [DRIVER] section all the printable (non-special) characters
# (the ones obeying the <Key> condition in the reference) are automatically bound by Pi Presents to the
# symbolic name pp-key-x   e.g the 'a' key produces pp-key-a
# automatic binding of printing keys can be overriden by individual specific-character input sections.

# the match conditions and the symbolic names are case sensitive.



# THE REAL STUFF
# ==============
# DUMMY .CFG FILE TO DISABLE KEYS.CFG IN pp, ALTERNATIVELY REMOVE KEYS.CFG FROM PP
